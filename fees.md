# Fees

> Understanding trading fees on Polymarket

Polymarket does not charge fees on most markets. However, certain markets have taker fees enabled to fund the [Maker Rebates Program](/market-makers/maker-rebates).

***

## Fee-Free Markets

The vast majority of Polymarket markets have **no trading fees**:

* No fees to deposit or withdraw USDC (though intermediaries like Coinbase or MoonPay may charge their own fees)
* No fees to trade shares

***

## Markets With Fees

The following market types charge a small taker fee on each trade. These fees are collected and redistributed daily to market makers as rebates, incentivizing deeper liquidity and tighter spreads.

* **All crypto markets** (1H, 4H, daily, and weekly starting March 6, 2026 for new markets)
* **NCAAB (college basketball) markets** (starting February 18, 2026 for new markets)
* **Serie A markets** (starting February 18, 2026 for new markets)

### Fee Structure

Fees are calculated using the following formula:

```text  theme={null}
fee = C × p × feeRate × (p × (1 - p))^exponent
```

Where **C** = number of shares traded and **p** = price of the shares. The fee parameters differ by market type:

| Parameter      | Sports (NCAAB, Serie A) | Crypto |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------ |
| Fee Rate       | 0.0175                  | 0.25   |
| Exponent       | 1                       | 2      |
| Maker Rebate % | 25%                     | 20%    |

Taker fees are calculated in USDC and vary based on the share price. However, fees are collected in shares on buy orders and USDC on sell orders. The effective rate **peaks at 50%** probability and decreases symmetrically toward the extremes.

### Fee Precision

Fees are rounded to 4 decimal places. The smallest fee charged is **0.0001 USDC**. Anything smaller rounds to zero, so very small trades near the extremes may incur no fee at all.

## Identifying Fee-Enabled Markets

The following market types have fees enabled:

* **All crypto markets** (1H, 4H, daily, and weekly starting March 6, 2026 for new markets)
* **NCAAB (college basketball) markets** (starting February 18, 2026 for new markets)
* **Serie A markets** (starting February 18, 2026 for new markets)

Query the fee-rate endpoint to check any specific market. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full endpoint documentation.

```bash  theme={null}
GET https://clob.polymarket.com/fee-rate?token_id={token_id}
```

## Fee Handling for API Users

### Using the SDK

The official CLOB clients **automatically handle fees** for you — they fetch the fee rate and include it in the signed order payload.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="TypeScript" icon="js" href="https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client">
    npm install @polymarket/clob-client\@latest
  </Card>

  <Card title="Python" icon="python" href="https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client">
    pip install --upgrade py-clob-client
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rust" icon="rust" href="https://github.com/Polymarket/rs-clob-client">
    cargo add polymarket-client-sdk
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**What the client does automatically:**

1. Fetches the fee rate for the market's token ID
2. Includes `feeRateBps` in the order structure
3. Signs the order with the fee rate included

**You don't need to do anything extra.** Your orders will work on fee-enabled markets.

### Using the REST API

If you're calling the REST API directly or building your own order signing, you must manually include the fee rate in your signed order payload.

**Step 1:** Fetch the fee rate for the token ID before creating your order:

```bash  theme={null}
GET https://clob.polymarket.com/fee-rate?token_id={token_id}
```

See the [fee-rate API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full response details. Fee-enabled markets return a non-zero value; fee-free markets return `0`.

**Step 2:** Add the `feeRateBps` field to your order object. This value is part of the signed payload — the CLOB validates your signature against it.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "salt": "12345",
  "maker": "0x...",
  "signer": "0x...",
  "taker": "0x...",
  "tokenId": "71321045679252212594626385532706912750332728571942532289631379312455583992563",
  "makerAmount": "50000000",
  "takerAmount": "100000000",
  "expiration": "0",
  "nonce": "0",
  "feeRateBps": "1000",
  "side": "0",
  "signatureType": 2,
  "signature": "0x..."
}
```

**Step 3:** Sign and submit:

1. Include `feeRateBps` in the order object **before signing**
2. Sign the complete order
3. POST to the order endpoint

<Note>
  Always fetch `fee_rate_bps` dynamically — do not hardcode. The fee rate varies
  by market type and may change over time. You only need to pass `feeRateBps`.
</Note>
